# Simple Shell

Explain how you transformed the assignment into code
Not "What does your code do?"
But "How does it do it?"

Focus on how your program works at the time you submit it

Don't go too much into the details of everything you tried to get there

Mention the limitations or peculiarities of your program if any

200 lines maximum
Generally 125-150 lines are perfectly enough!

## Summary

This program will create a shell that will take command-line inputs and execute them correctly. While practicing high-quality C code to implement a shell which deals with parsing command-line arguments accordingly by utilizing error management in order to execute various system calls with an emphasis on processes, files and pipes.

## Implementation



### Parsing Options

We begin our execution with creating a data structure which will contain the data of our commands. Our struct `aCommand` contains:
	`processName which contains the command `
